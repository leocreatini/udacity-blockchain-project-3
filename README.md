# Udacity Blockchain Project 2

Build an API to get block info.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
nodejs@^10.0.0
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

1.

```
yarn

// or

npm install
```

And repeat

```
yarn start

Open browser to http://localhost:8080/block/0 to see the 0th block information. You can then replace the "0" with any other positive integer that's equal or less than the current block height (XXXXXXX as of this time).
